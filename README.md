# Vigenere-cipher
I created a Vigenére Cipher encryption/decryption application

This is a project i did for my CS class in school.
I wanted to make an encryption/decryption app, I originally made a not so perfect version of the Enigma machine, and that didn't quite satisfy me.
So i changed the encryption methood to the Vigenére Cipher.
After making the encryotion functiona and decryption function, i made a mail function that lets the user send the encrypted word through mail.
That's about it about my project.
